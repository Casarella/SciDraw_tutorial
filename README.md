Quickstart guide for M. Caprio's Mathematica package, SciDraw

Nuclear Structure figures rely heavily upon drawing simple or complex nuclear level schemes

M. Caprio's custom package, SciDraw does this adeptly inside of the Mathematica container

His distribution includes the full (mostly complete as of Feb 20, 2017) documentation, but can be cumbersome to read if one needs a 'quick and dirty' level scheme for a figure.

This guide is meant to get the user acquainted with the basic/common syntax and up-and-running within a few minutes.

Read:

for the guide.

Inlcuded are several templates and examples used in my work.
